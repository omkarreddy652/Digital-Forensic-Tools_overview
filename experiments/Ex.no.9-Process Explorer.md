---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Procedure

### Step 1: Download and Setup Process Explorer

**🎯 Purpose:** Obtain and configure Process Explorer for system process analysis.

**📋 Instructions:**

1. **📥 Go to the official Microsoft Sysinternals website:**
   🔗 [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer)

2. **⬇️ Click **Download Process Explorer**.**

3. **📦 Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a folder.**

4. **👨‍💼 Right-click `procexp64.exe` (for 64-bit) or `procexp.exe` (for 32-bit) → select **Run as Administrator**.**

---

### Step 2: Understand the Interface

**🎯 Purpose:** Familiarize yourself with Process Explorer's interface and color coding system.

**📋 Instructions:**

1. **🌳 The main window displays all running processes in a **hierarchical tree view**.**

2. **📊 Each process shows details such as **PID**, **CPU usage**, **memory usage**, and **company name**.**

3. **🎨 Color codes represent process states:**
   - 🟩 **Green** — Newly started processes
   - 🟥 **Red** — Terminated processes
   - 🟦 **Light Blue** — Processes running under the current user
   - 🟪 **Pink** — Suspended processes

### Step 3: Identify Suspicious Processes

**🎯 Purpose:** Learn to recognize potentially malicious processes through various indicators.

**📋 Instructions:**

1. **🔍 Look for **unfamiliar or oddly named processes** (e.g., `xkdjeo.exe`, `randomname123.exe`).**

2. **🏢 Check the **Company Name** and **Description**:**
   - Legitimate software usually shows known publishers like *Microsoft*, *Intel*, or *Adobe*.

3. **🖱️ Right-click the process → **Properties** → go to the **Image** tab.**

4. **📁 Verify the **Path** of the executable file:**
   - ✅ **Safe:** `C:\Windows\System32\`
   - ⚠️ **Suspicious:** `C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Temp\` or `Downloads\`

5. **🔐 Check for **Digital Signature**:**
   - Valid signature = trusted developer
   - No signature or invalid = possibly malicious

### Step 4: Analyze Process Behavior

**🎯 Purpose:** Monitor resource usage and network activity to detect malicious behavior.

**📋 Instructions:**

1. **📊 Observe **CPU**, **Memory**, and **I/O usage** columns.**

2. **⚠️ If a small or unknown process consumes **excessive CPU or memory**, it may be malicious.**

3. **🌐 Right-click the process → **Properties** → go to the **TCP/IP tab**.**
   - Check if it communicates with **unknown external IP addresses**.

4. **🔧 Examine **Handles** and **DLLs** tabs for suspicious loaded files or libraries.**

</p>
</details>

---

### Step 5: Verify Process Legitimacy

**🎯 Purpose:** Use external resources to confirm whether a process is legitimate or malicious.

**📋 Instructions:**

1. **🔍 Search the process name on Google.**
   Example: `svchost.exe` vs `svhost.exe` (one letter missing — suspicious).

2. **🛡️ Visit 🔗 [https://www.virustotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com)**
   - Upload the process file or search its name to verify if it's reported as malware.

3. **📚 Cross-check with **ProcessLibrary.com** or official vendor websites for authenticity.**

### Step 6: Take Appropriate Action

**🎯 Purpose:** Execute proper procedures to handle identified malicious processes.

**📋 Instructions:**

1. **🚨 If the process is confirmed malicious:**
   - Right-click the process → **Kill Process** to stop it.
   - Delete the corresponding executable file from its path.

2. **🤔 If unsure:**
   - Right-click → **Suspend Process** to stop it temporarily for investigation.

3. **🧹 After removal:**
   - Run a **Full System Scan** using Windows Defender or Malwarebytes to ensure no remnants remain.

### Step 7: Example Observation

**🎯 Purpose:** Practical example of identifying and handling a malicious process.

**📋 Case Study:**

**🔍 Discovery:** You find `faangpath_simple_template.pdf` consuming 70% CPU.

**📊 Analysis Results:**
- **📁 Path:** `C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Temp\faangpath_simple_template.pdf`
- **🔐 Digital Signature:** None
- **🏢 Company Name:** Unknown
- **🌐 Network Activity:** Shows connections to unknown IPs in the TCP/IP tab
- **🛡️ Online Check:** VirusTotal confirms it as a **known trojan**
