## Aim
To use **The Sleuth Kit (TSK)**, a collection of command-line tools, to analyze a disk image, examine its file system, and recover digital evidence.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites & Installation

1.  **Download Sleuth Kit:**
    * Visit the official Sleuth Kit website or the Google Drive link provided to download the latest version for Windows.
2.  **Install Sleuth Kit:**
    * Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Add the installation's `bin` directory to your system's PATH environment variable to run TSK commands from any terminal.
3.  **Acquire Evidence Image:**
    * You must have a disk image to analyze (e.g., `.E01`, `.dd`, `.raw`). For this lab, we will use the `4Dell Latitude CPi.E01` files.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Acquire Disk Image
- Before analysis, ensure you have the evidence files (`.E01`, `.E02`, etc.) in a dedicated case folder.
- For this experiment, we will use the sample image: `4Dell Latitude CPi.E01`.

---

### Step 2: Start Analysis (List Partitions)
- Open **Command Prompt (CMD)** as Administrator.
- Navigate to your case folder.
- Use the `mmls` (list partitions) command to view the partition table of the disk image. This helps you find the offset of the partition you want to analyze.

```bash
# mmls [image_file_name]
mmls "4Dell Latitude CPi.E01"
