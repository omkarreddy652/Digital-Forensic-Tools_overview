## 📝 Notes

⚠️ **Legal Compliance:** Always ensure you have proper authorization before performing forensic extraction on any device. This tool should only be used for legitimate forensic investigations, academic research, or on devices you own.

🔒 **Data Security:** Handle extracted data with appropriate security measures. Forensic data may contain sensitive personal information that must be protected according to relevant privacy laws and regulations.

📱 **Device Compatibility:** AFLogical OSE works best with Android devices running older versions. Some newer Android versions may have enhanced security features that limit logical extraction capabilities.

🔍 **Further Analysis:** The extracted CSV data can be analyzed using various forensic tools and techniques:
- **Excel/Google Sheets** - Basic data analysis and visualization
- **Autopsy** - Advanced forensic analysis platform
- **Timeline Analysis** - Chronological event reconstruction
- **Data Correlation** - Cross-referencing multiple data sources

💡 **Best Practices:**
- Always create forensic images before extraction
- Document all procedures and findings thoroughly
- Maintain chain of custody for evidence
- Use write-blocking techniques when possible
